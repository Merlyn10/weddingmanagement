Validation Messages
<p>Data submitted in a form is usually validated in some way. And if there is any unacceptable data, the form is traditionally re-displayed, together with validation messages. In such a case, it is important to immediately inform screen reader users, so they know that they have to look at their data and submit again.</p>
